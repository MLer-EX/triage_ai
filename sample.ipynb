    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the Triage AI Project! This project aims to provide a machine learning solution for predicting the triage level of patients based on various medical parameters. The model helps in quickly assessing the severity of a patient's condition, ensuring timely and appropriate medical attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "Here's a quick overview of the project structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used for training and testing the models.\n",
    "- `models/`: Contains the trained models and associated files.\n",
    "- `scripts/`: Contains the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.\n",
    "- `results/`: Stores the evaluation results and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Ensure you have the following software installed:\n",
    "- Python 3.7+\n",
    "- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Instructions\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
